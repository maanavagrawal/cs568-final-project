I was talking about her to another friend and like yesterday he mentioned her because he saw her boyfriend. He was like, “She gave up her writing for this guy? Really?” And I was like, “Huh. It’ s interesting you say she gave up her writing because she’ s turned in like a couple of really good stories and I’m like in awe of her . And it’ s really strange to hear she gave up writing because she’ s so totally not even looking like she gave up writing. She seems like very much on top of things now . Like she turns in her homework and she writes these good things, you know , like...” It doesn’ t mean I let myself get  by that. I could. I’m like always pulling my hair out to get this done, get that done. She’ s always like  doing it. But like so she... I guess she and the guy moved in together and I assume she’ s not really paying rent because, you know , he’s... He makes much more than her . But... Where was I going with this?  Yeah. I guess I was trying to understand. I’m always looking at other people and what they do and trying to ask myself, “Should I do this? Should I do that? Is that how it’ s done?” So then I’m like, “I need to...”  Like last year , when she was all crazy about love and everything, I was like, “I want that. You know , I want to be crazy and not do any work.” And now that she’ s stable, I’m like, “Maybe I want that.” You know? Like maybe I need to, need... Like the equivalent of her boyfriend would be Chris, you know , like stable, steady , always there, you know , makes money and lets me live with him rent free. Maybe I need that.

Am I at a phase where I need stability or like am I still in my crazy phase where it’ s like, “No. I need inspiration or I need to do everything myself so I feel confident and then I can write better .”  Yeah. Maybe I’ll the sort of person... Maybe my psychology is that, at the base level, I feel helpless. So I have to do all these things to prove to myself that I can do it. Then once I have that high, then I can write. [00:38:1 1] Maybe she’ s already up here in terms of confidence level and independence. So she just needs to kind of settle down and... You know? I don’ t know .    She’ s lived like a lot more years being single and she’ s divorced. So...  I don’ t know . I have to compare myself.   I guess I do that also to give myself options and be like, “There are choices I could make.” You know? And I guess it’s okay to some degree to be like, “What is that person doing? Could I do that?”" ', 'therapist_result': 'Yeah. It does... I mean, you certainly use other people to compare yourself and often compare yourself downward. You often... You also look at people for models although you make a lot of assumptions in that model. You have no idea. She could be paying all the rent for all you know . You have no idea. So you make a lot of assumptions about what that relationship is like and how he’ s really like Chris. And so, in a sense, it’ s a projection.

The way you’re describing it is sort of like... “It was a phase for her . She’ s done that.” It was a little more than a phase. She fell in love with a guy that she’ s now married to. I mean, she’ s grown a lot in that. She didn’ t want to write. It was really important to her . It’ s not just that she stopped writing. She couldn’ t write. It was really stressful. You know , it was harder to concentrate. I’m not saying that you haven’t had some of that experience too. But that’ s not... [00:40:02] That’ s just not... I think that...  Maybe that’ s not how it is for you. Maybe it’ s not that you’re going through a phase of wanting stability that you’ll get over . Maybe it’ s that you’re ready for a relationship, that’ s your next step and that you don’ t want to do things that will get in the way of that, or that...

If I said to you—for example, let’ s say I didn’ t believe something you were saying—but if I just said to you, “I don’t believe you,” you might never come back again. So he [maybe put and partly]  sort of pacing himself with how to constructively , slowly , over time challenge some of the defenses. Like people’ s defenses exist for a reason. If I were to say the minute, the first day I meet someone, “Y ou’re defending yourself in this XYZ,” like people—it’ s not palatable. So he may—they may be at a place where it’ s just slow going to get to that point. He’ s not directly confronting some of it. Again, I’m extrapolating a little bit.

Then I get the application and it’ s this really thick thing. There are like a million things you have to write. There’ s this huge list of things it wants. It’ s really complicated. He never looks at it. I’m going to give it to him when it’ s done. He never looks at it. Then when it’ s done I give it to him. He’ s like this is great. It’ s better than what I wrote at your age. I was like, wait. I didn’ t get to show it to you the whole time. I’m like, wow. That’ s weird. He’ s like, well, I had a sense. I knew what you were talking about.

I was like, I didn’ t want to give it to you for the whole time. He’ s like, oh yeah, you didn’ t. I was like, yeah. I was kind of upset about that. I was like, it’ s not clear how much he would actually know about what was necessary in the application. It seems like it was something he had just seen before. It seemed really important to me that I have him see it. I could have been wrong. I’m not entirely sure I was, but I was upset that he hadn’ t wanted to see it until the end.

There’ll be times when you feel isolated or anxious or sad; those are parts of human experience and being able to tolerate those periods without becoming overwhelmed by them.

It reminds me a little bit about being in graduate school and working on the dissertation and feeling really isolated. And at times I had a lot of anxiety and trouble managing time and staying organized. And I started working with a therapist at the time, a psychologist. And part of it was just to talk about some stress and anxiety and sadness around those feelings. But one of the things that I started to realize as we talked, I think, was just kind of a little bit of the stress of the time was the day could go by without my seeing anyone other than the library staff that I was working with. And it’ s not like I could get up and leave work and go to lunch with colleagues or anything like that because I was just working there all day. So I started realizing that the isolation was really difficult and that I was really starting to feel worse at night as things started to slow down. And at first they had to stop me from going there at night on Saturday and Sunday when I got really stressed. But one thing that we started to do is it would be a little bit of an obligation for me to call my therapist at night when I was really stressed and just talk to them and I would be busy for a little while. It doesn t sound like the big thing but it was the small piece of human connection. And I guess what I’m saying about that is you don’ t necessarily know how you might handle it. But even just in having that story with me there was a little bit of the anxiety I had at that time was feeling very isolated and very alone in what I was doing and working on.

I mean, I was thinking of this when you’re saying that one of the reasons you haven’ t done this sooner was because you were worried that this would make things worse, you’ve actually gone through a phase of this. When you and Jennie work on stuf f, it has made things worse. I guess I was thinking that, you know, what I think may be part of why that is, is you guys actually go in and are working on dif ferent things, and each of you has expectations that the other one doesn’ t share, and so when it doesn’ t happen or works dif ferently than either of you expect, it actually gets more frustrating or hurtful.'},

It sounds to me like he felt like, you know , there was going to come a point where you just couldn’ t handle this, there was too much stress, you couldn’ t carry it, you couldn’ t carry the responsibility for it, and it was going to break you. But for you, it’ s more like you have all the feelings associated with something big happening, being overwhelmed, being sad about something, or being upset about something, and the panic is a very concrete way of coping with that.

I don't think they're related other than through you. Yeah, yeah. So, yeah, I think that, you know , that part, too, is just like she doesn't have the same relationship with him that you do. And it's more like, you know , he wasn't really excited about going to Canada but they were going and it was her jacket for 12 years. She had it a long time. I think it was a good idea for a 15-year-to buy a jacket that's going to last 12 years, but, you know , I'm sure he would have preferred something else. And I think it was more her thing.

And she went more with thinking and planning and saving and saying, \'this is what I want.\' And she asked for a Northface jacket for Christmas when she was like 15 and, you know , it was like a $300 jacket and it was the jacket that year . And she kept telling my dad like she would wear it every day , she would wear it forever , like it would last forever , like it would be great. And she got it. And like she wore that for 12 years, like that was her jacket for the next 12 years. She wore it until we went we were on a Canada trip and it rained like, it just rained constantly during that trip and she realized like the jacket was not waterproof anymore and  jacket was not waterproof anymore and Papa\'s main jacket also was not waterproof anymore so we were all basically just like wet for a week straight. I tend to go with asking for things that are going to cause father to blow up by their being dif ferent. But then not really liking them very much. : [00:33:33 00:33:44]" mental health assistant: "Oh. I guess I\'m a little concerned with your proving that that\'s true. I think you\'re of f a little bit. I mean I think I understand that she wanted like an expensive jacket but I wouldn\'t call that champagne. It was a popular jacket. I understand if a kid wants that stuf f, you\'re growing up, but she wore it for 12 years. That\'s not champagne." patient: "Oh, I know . Yeah."

And so when I think about how that kind of feels to you, yeah, it sounds like it feels more, you're more skeptical about the benefits. And also, I guess the excitement of a new jacket and then wearing it for 12 years, that excitement kind of feels more, you know , maybe even more like you're going to be disappointed with it somehow , it's not going to work out like you thought it would.
