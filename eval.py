That's a valid feeling. It's okay to feel this way, even when someone is clearly demonstrating care. What aspects of the relationship are leaving you feeling this disconnect?

That makes a lot of sense.\n\nCan you tell me more about what those feelings are like when you go home?  What specific emotions are you trying to control?\n\nYou mentioned that these defenses, this intense cleaning, are protective.  That's a very valid point.  Everyone needs healthy coping mechanisms. But you're also recognizing that it might be becoming *too* compulsive, leading to hurt and exhaustion.  Can you expand on that?  What are some examples of how this intense cleaning impacts you after you’ve been home?\n\nYou suggested that perhaps allowing yourself to feel some of these emotions, even just a little, and finding other ways to manage them besides the cleaning, might be helpful. You’ve already suggested some alternatives, like spending time with Emma, going for walks, or running errands. What are your thoughts on exploring those possibilities?  Is there anything else you think might be helpful in creating more space for feelings and self-care?\n\nFinally, you said you're doing the best you can with what's inside you, and that's incredibly important to acknowledge.
